# e621 Dataset Maker
An [e621](https://e621.net) api tool for downloading images and tags of posts for creating datasets.

Currently the script only supports downloading posts based on tags but I'm planning on adding Pool downloading feature. (Will probably never happen)

## Requirements:
> [Python 3.0 or higher version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Usage
Launch the script and type in tags of your choice and amount of posts you'd like to download.
The amount of posts can be unlimited.
Then choose a folder where you want to save those files in.
