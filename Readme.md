# e621-Downloader
A python script that downloads unlimited amount of posts from [e621.net](https://e621.net).

Currently the script only supports downloading posts based on tags but I'm planning on adding Pool downloading feature. (Will probably never happen)

## Requirements:
> [Python 3.0 or higher version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You will also need to install a few libraries using pip command in the command prompt:

```
pip install requests
```

For Windows:
```
pip install tk
```
For Ubuntu/apt:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```



## Usage
Launch the script and type in tags of your choice and amount of posts you'd like to download.
The amount of posts can be unlimited.
Then choose a folder where you want to save those files in.
